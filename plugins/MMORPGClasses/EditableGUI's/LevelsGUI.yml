# This GUI is fully customisable, you can display your levels and
# rewards here. Please note this GUI is entirely cosmetic and does not
# grant rewards upon levelling up, the plugin automatically does that for you!
# You can use this GUI to give information to as what EXP is required and what
# rewards are gained for levelling up.
