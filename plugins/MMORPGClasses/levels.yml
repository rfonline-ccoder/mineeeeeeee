# Passive-experience is the experience gained every 30 minutes
# for playing on the server. You can edit the value gained.

# Experience to level is the experience required to finish the level.
# So 1:1000 means 1000exp to level up to level 2 and so on.

# You can add any and all mobs, currently in the game, to the experience-mobs
# section of this configuration file. Please follow the format below, to ensure
# it always works. The value after the mob is how much exp is gained for
# killing the mob.

# Please set the max-level to the same amount of levels you have. If you have 50 levels,
# please set the max level to 50. This just makes all the code work better and enhances
# your experience with the levelling system.
