# This is a very basic configuration for the points shop. If you require any support
# in configurating the points shop please join the community/support discord and use the
# appropriate channel to ask for assistance.

# Items are listed as "ITEM" - example: "STONE", "EMERALD_BLOCK" etc.
# Commands do not use the forward slash "/" like they do within the game,
# please do not use them when editing/adding commands as it will not work.
