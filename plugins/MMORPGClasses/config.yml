# In regards to the loot chests spawn frequency and amount during spawn, I would not recommend spawning a lot
# at a quick frequency to maintain server performance.

Settings:
  SpawnFrequencySeconds: 30 # How often loot chests spawn around the map.
  MaxChestsPerSpawn: 3 # How many chests spawn every time.
  SpawnRadius: 500
  SpawnWorld: resourceworld # Change this to the name of the world you want them to spawn in.
